title: API Rate Limits
position: 5
---

There are no hard set API limits while this project is in Alpha. Out of courtesy please limit api requests to;

 * one request per second for regular endpoints
 * batch sizes below 2000 with one request per minutes for bulk endpoints

 We would appreciate feedback on system performance.
