Memair adheres to a deprecation schedule however, any endpoint or data structure may be changed or deprecated if there is a security issue. Currently all endpoints are Beta (except for those with deprecation notices).

#### Alpha endpoints
Alpha endpoints are in active development and will likely change or become deprecated.

#### Beta endpoints
Beta endpoints are being tested more widely with beta users and are unlikely to change. Any non backward compatible changes or deprecation will have at least 4 weeks notice.

#### Gamma endpoints
Gamma endpoints have been throughly tested. Any non backward compatible changes or deprecation will have at least 6 months notice.

### Notices

The following endpoints will be deprecated and replaced with [GraphQL](/#graphqlgraphql) equivalents.

* [api/v1/biometrics](#restbiometrics_get) (GraphQL version live)
* [api/v1/emotions](#restsemotions_get)
