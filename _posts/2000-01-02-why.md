## Our heads are too small for our minds

Our minds are not limited to what exists in our heads. If you ask me if I know the time, I will answer yes, and then reference my watch. The current knowledge of time does not exist in my head, however it is so accessible that it is an extension of my mind. We believe that the data you create should be as easily accessible to you.
