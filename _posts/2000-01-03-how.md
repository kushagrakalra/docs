## Giving you access to the data you create

### Remember

Actions you do in the physical world create digital traces. Whenever you check Facebook your browser remembers, when you spend the day at work your phone knows, when you GChat a friend Google remembers, when you're binge watching your favorite TV show Plex/Netflix knows, when your heart races Fitbit remembers.

### Recall

Memair gives you access to the data you create and the ability to easily recall the digital memories you create. Easily recall how often you check facebook, when you are at work, how many hours you spend watching TV, or when your heart races.

### Derive insight

Derive insight from disparate data sources. Discover the GChat conversations that increase your heart rate, understand your Facebook usage patterns, become aware of how much of your week you spend watching Plex/Netflix.
